The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
room; then she put them up and looked out under them.+ She seldom or
never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were
her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for "style," not
service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.+
She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear:

"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--+"

She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with.+ She resurrected nothing but the cat.+

"I never did see the beat of that boy!+"

She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden.+ No Tom.+ So
she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:

"Y-o-u-u TOM!+"

There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.+

"There!+ I might 'a' thought of that closet.+ What you been doing in
there?+"

"Nothing.+"

"Nothing!+ Look at your hands.+ And look at your mouth.+ What _is_ that
truck?+"

"I don't know, aunt.+"

"Well, I know.+ It's jam--that's what it is.+ Forty times I've said if you
didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you.+ Hand me that switch.+"

The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--+

"My!+ Look behind you, aunt!+"

The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.+
The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it.+

His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.+

"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything?+ Ain't he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?+ But old
fools is the biggest fools there is.+ Can't learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is.+ But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know what's coming?+ He 'pears to know just how long
he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and
I can't hit him a lick.+ I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's
the Lord's truth, goodness knows.+ Spare the rod and spile the child,
as the Good Book says.+ I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both,
I know.+ He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own
dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,
somehow.+ Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
every time I hit him my old heart most breaks.+ Well-a-well, man that is
born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture
says, and I reckon it's so.+ He'll play hookey this evening, * and [*
Southwestern for "afternoon"] I'll just be obleeged to make him work,
tomorrow, to punish him.+ It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,
when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he
hates anything else, and I've _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or
I'll be the ruination of the child.+"

THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made
a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg.+
So vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible.+
When he had finished, Mr. Jones said: " I thought I had fixed
up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don't amount
to anything now.+
"Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, "whoever nipped
the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.+"
"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!+"
You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey.+
Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so.+
The weary time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken.+
Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.+

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he caught him out.+"
To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope.+ Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived.+ He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined.+ At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away.+ So he went away; but
he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.+

He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness.+
